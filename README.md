**__Things to Note →__**

    I am medically diagnosed with Anxiety and Depression [MDD], working on a diagnosis for DID, Autism, and some other things (**ALWAYS INT WITH EXTREME CAUTION**). I'm fine with mostly any jokes - though please use tonetags, or i'll ask your tone. I get easily upset, so if I seem stand-off-ish in a way, that's probably why (don't take it into offense or think you are the problem of it). I do **block freely**, keep in mind of that. To tie back to the mental illnesses, I possibly do have Bipolar, Narcissism, or both; expect mood swings and episodes. If something I say upsets you, let me know. I cannot read your mind. <- I am open to vents, just dont expect any professional advice. Don't take what I say as me saying whatever out of pity. **I mean what I say when I am comforting you.** Taken, and not looking depends though, really). Though, me and my partner have discussed and are fine with me having platonic partners<3.If you want to know anything else, or have any questions feel free to ask. __Keep in mind I can ignore / decline any questions I deem too personal, or if I just don't want to answer it__
